# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

<img src="advent.png"/>

Here are my solutions for Advent of Code 2023. My goal this year was to solve as
many problems as possible in Awk. Each directory in this project includes a
README.md that states the problem for that day, along with steps for running the
solution.

If you think this is silly, have a look at [my solutions for
2020](https://github.com/brandon1024/aoc2018), which included a [linux kernel
module](https://github.com/brandon1024/aoc2020/tree/master/day-3) and a [sed
script](https://github.com/brandon1024/aoc2020/tree/master/day-4).
